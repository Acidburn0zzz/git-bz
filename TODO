Ideas about additions for git-bz
================================

The presence of an idea here does not necessarily imply that I have
any intention of working on it myself.

-u/--add-url Option

  When specified, local commits are edited to append the Bug URL.

    attach: Before attaching them to the bug

  Requires: clean index and a series of bugs that leads to the
    current HEAD commit.
  Can't be the default because commits might have already been pushed
  Should be smart if the URL is already in the bug
  Might be useful to have a standalone 'add-url' subcommand that can
    be used to fix up if you forget to specify it.

Use XML-RPC when available.

  Maybe use python-bugzilla: http://fedorahosted.org/python-bugzilla/

  Not sure there are a lot of advantages to this; one thing that it
  might be possible to do with this is allow the user to specify only
  the product and get an interactive list of components. Also, better
  error handling.

Handle redirects:

  Should follow redirects, both to different URLs and http => https

Better display of errors

  Currently specifying a non-existent product/component just dumps
  out raw HTML for the reply. Etc.
